# Fortune 1000 (US) Companies 2020

Exploration of dataset of the 2021 Fortune 1000 Companies. My initial goal was to see how many of these companies have women CEO's. Despite 2021 being the year with the highest number of women CEOs in the top 1000, they are still a minority. Moreover, in terms of CEOs who also founded the company, we only see one - Anne Noonan of Summit Materials. While only 3 companies in the retail sector feature in the top 1000, the top one of these - Walmart - is miles ahead of even the second place - Amazon - in terms of revenue.
